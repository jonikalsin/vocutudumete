They announced their engagement on Instagram back in January with a pic that featured Cook showing off her huge diamond ring.</p><p>“Looking forward to eternity with my love. I LOVE YOU LOVE!!!” wrote Cook in the caption.</p><p>An insider told E! News that David’s baby news came as a big surprise to Shannon Beador.</p><p>“Shannon was very shocked when she heard the news about David,” dished the source. “The girls are excited that their dad is happy, but it’s still very fresh to them. The girls still have a great relationship with their dad, but it was a huge surprise to them.”</p><p>The end of Shannon and David’s relationship played out in front of Bravo cameras for several seasons on the Real Housewives of Orange County. During Season 10, Shannon revealed that David had cheated, but despite going through therapy and renewing their vows, the former couple ultimately called it quits.</p><p>Shannon Beador has since moved on with her new boyfriend John Janssen. They have been dating for a year, and she gives fans frequent relationship updates on Instagram. In March, Shannon shared a love letter Janssen wrote for her that said their “connection and chemistry are what people dream about.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CBrwvx_FW4e/</p><p>“You are my person; the one I was meant to be with, the one that makes me feel whole,” Janssen told Beador. “I started falling in love with you almost immediately and my love has grown ever stronger as our time together has flown by.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The cast of the Real Housewives of Orange County is expected to resume filming season 15 later this month after the COVID-19 pandemic shut down production in mid-March.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeinbykecOaraKcXZeyorDOq2Siq12owaK%2B06KloGWRYrumw4yfmKahnK56uLXToWShoaNis6qtzZycnmWRo7FutMisZJ6wXay2p7GMrJ%2Bapp6ku2610mapnqifp8GmsMuyZKygn5i4prCMbWhuamVofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./newjeans-danielle-is-now-the-global-ambassador-of-burberry.html><span>←</span><span>NewJeans Danielle Is Now The Global Ambassador Of Burberry</span></a>
