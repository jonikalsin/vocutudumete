<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Tyler Ritter's (Arrow) Wiki Biography, age, wife, gay, net worth</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>• Tyler Ritter is an American actor, best known for his role in the TV sitcom “The McCarthys”.<br>• He is from Los Angeles, and his father, John Ritter, was a popular actor.<br>• He pursued a career in teaching after his father's death, but eventually returned to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of becoming an actor.<br>• Tyler is married to Argentinian film director Lelia Parma, and they have a son named Benjamin.<br>• He is also the lead singer and bassist of the band The All-American Rejects and is part of several charitable organizations.</p>﻿ ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<h2><span id=Tyler_Ritter_Arrow_Wiki_Biography>Tyler Ritter (Arrow) Wiki Biography</span></h2><p>Tyler Ritter was born in Los Angeles, California USA, on 31 January 1985, so under the zodiac sign of Aquarius and holding American nationality – he is popular through his career of an actor, especially for his role in the <a rel=nofollow href=#>“McCarthys”</a> TV sitcom.</p><h2><span id=Childhood_and_education>Childhood and education</span></h2><p>Tyler grew up in family full of people involved in acting and music. His father John Ritter was a popular actor, while his brother Jason is an actor as well – his granddad was a popular country singer named Tex. Tyler spent his entire childhood in Los Angeles ,and grew up with a dream of becoming an actor just as his father.</p><p>Tyler played numerous roles in high school, and starred in several student films, however, when his father died unexpectedly on 11 September 2003, Tyler was really hurt and decided not to pursue a career in acting. He enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania, and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in 2007, becoming a teacher rather than pursuing his dreams of becoming an actor, and therefore pushed that idea aside.</p><h2><span id=Career_of_an_actor_and_other_jobs>Career of an actor and other jobs</span></h2><p>As soon as he got his degree, Tyler tried to run away from Los Angeles, and went to Argentina to work as a teacher. He stayed there for three years, however, he wasn’t able to escape himself, and acting proved to be his true calling – once he turned 25, Tyler went back to Los Angeles and focused on his career as an actor.</p><p>He launched his career with small roles in “Modern Family” and “Grey’s Anatomy” TV series, until he landed the role for which he is popular today – he became Ronny McCarthy, the star of “The McCarthys” 2014 sitcom. Ronny is a gay son in a family which counts six members, and judging by the written critiques, Tyler did an amazing job playing this role.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/tyler-ritter-arrow-thecw-1024x584.jpg></p><p>In 2015, Tyler appeared in a single episode of the “NCIS” US police procedural TV series as the brother of Abby Sciuto; he has also appeared in an episode of “NCIS: New Orleans”.</p><p>Although he was out of the media for a while as he did not have any significant roles, Tyler came back into the spotlight in 2016 after landing roles in the “Young and Hungry” comedy TV series, and playing Detective Billy Malone in the very popular “Arrow” CW series.</p><p>Tyler’s latest roles were in “The Good Doctor” TV series in 2018, in which he appeared in the single episode “Empathy” as George Reynolds, and in the movie “Stillwater” also in 2018, in which he played Dawson.</p><h2><span id=The_McCarthys_TV_sitcom>“The McCarthys” TV sitcom</span></h2><p>“The McCarthys” American sitcom is the show which made Tyler somewhat famous – it was created by Brian Gallivan alongside Mike Sikowitz, Will Gluck, Richard Schwarz, and Andy Ackerman, and was made for CBS Television Studios and Sony Pictures Television, with the first episode airing on CBS in 2014.</p><p>On 3 February 2015 the show was taken off TV after only 11 episodes being aired and four left unaired. On 8 May 2015, the cancellation of the series was made official, but then it was &nbsp;announced on 12 June 2015 that the remaining four episodes would be aired on Saturday evenings – the official closure of the series was on 11 July 2015 after counting only one season and 15 episodes.</p><p>The series follows the lives of the McCarthys, a working class family living in Boston whose members are all into sports – the father of the family named Arthur, who works as a basketball coach at the Cardinal Hennigan High School, decides to support his gay son Ronny by teaching him basketball. Ronny is played by Tyler Ritter who is completely disinterested in sports, while his two siblings in the show are both angry at their father as they are very sporting and were looking forward to being chosen by their dad.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Team <a rel=nofollow href=#>#whatjusthappened</a> is really cookin now. <a rel=nofollow href=#>#SDCC2019</a> with <a rel=nofollow href=#>@ShiriAppleby</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>@KevinZegers</a> and <a rel=nofollow href=#>#fredsavage</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/FyEjW9004R</a></p><p>— Tyler Ritter (@TylerRitter) <a rel=nofollow href=#>July 19, 2019</a></p><h2><span id=Personal_life_and_relationships>Personal life and relationships</span></h2><p>Tyler hasn’t talked much about his love life as he prefers to keep his personal matters to himself, however, some things about his partner are still known.</p><p>Tyler is married to his other half Lelia Parma. The two met soon after Tyler went to Argentina to work as a teacher, and married in the same year after dating for only a couple of months. Lelia is an Argentinian film director, and she was the one to encourage Tyler to go back to Los Angeles and pursue his dreams of becoming an actor, as it was not hard for her to see that he was very passionate about it, and hadn’t proceeded only because of his father’s death. Tyler and Lelia are parents to a boy, <a rel=nofollow href=#>Benjamin Parma Ritter</a> born in 2017.</p><p>Tyler hasn’t spoken about any women he might have dated before Lelia, as he would not like to make his wife jealous.</p><h2><span id=Likes_and_other_interests>Likes and other interests</span></h2><p>Tyler is mostly focused on his acting career, as it is his biggest passion, but he has other interests as well.</p><p>Tyler is also a musician and is the lead singer and the bassist of The All-American Rejects alternative rock band – one of their most popular songs is <a rel=nofollow href=#>“Swing, Swing”</a>. He became a philanthropist shortly after his father died, as he is part of the John Ritter Foundation for Aortic Health which is a charity organization founded to honor his father – Tyler also often volunteers with the Young Storytellers Foundation, which is a non-profit organization with the goal of developing literacy in children.</p><h2><span id=Death_of_his_father_John_Ritter>Death of his father John Ritter</span></h2><p>Tyler’s father John Ritter died on 11 September 2003 due to heart problems, while he was getting ready to film his lines in the “8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter”. John started sweating and vomiting and complaining about the pain in his chest. The Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center was right across the street from the Walk Disney Studios where he was at – actually the same place where he was born. He was diagnosed with a heart attack, and died during surgery performed to repair his aortic dissection, just six days before his 55th birthday.</p><h2><span id=Appearance_and_net_worth>Appearance and net worth</span></h2><p>Tyler is currently 34 years old. He has short brown hair and blue eyes, and is 6ft 1in (1.85m) tall, while his weight is not known.</p><p>According to authoritative sources, his current net worth is estimated to be more than $600,000 and is steadily rising thanks to his career as an actor.</p><h2><span id=Social_media_presence>Social media presence</span></h2><p>Just as most other celebrities on the internet, Tyler is quite active on several popular social media platforms. He launched his Twitter account in April 2013, and has gathered more than 9,500 followers and tweeted nearly 900 times. His <a rel=nofollow href=#>Instagram account</a> is currently followed by more than 4,000 people, while he’s uploaded over 200 pictures onto it – he has a Facebook profile as well, but seems to be using it just to keep in touch with his friends and family.</p>, <a href=#>Wikipedia</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCpnZSerm%2B70aBmrbGcmr9uvsitq56qo2Kus77OsGSwoZueeqO1zqCpmqiYrnqis8RmrqKelWK0osWMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./162413-eskom-security-head-karen-pillay-temporary-boot-investigation-r500m-security-contract.html><span>←</span><span>Eskom Gives Security Head Karen Pillay Suspended For Probe Into R500m Contract To Be Conducted Unhin</span></a>
