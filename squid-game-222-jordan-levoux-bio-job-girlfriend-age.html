A model, Jordan recently shared a TikTok video in which she discussed how tough the challenges were, which were modeled on the wildly popular South Korean series Squid Game.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>“Red Light/Green Light was by far the hardest challenge we had to do for the entire series because each time the music stopped we had to hold our position for 30 to 40 minutes,” Jordan explained. ‘This made the game go for eleven hours. That is an insane amount of time to be standing around doing not much. It was so cold, the middle of England during winter. This resulted in people having seizures and dropping. It was a crazy experience.”</p><p>“I liked it. I’m not sure what everyone was expecting, did you think they were just going to hand over $ 4.56 million? No, we were going to be put through the paces,” Jordan shared about his feelings towards the show. “I went into the next day really hungry but I signed up for this. I knew what I was getting myself into.”</p><p>“Now, people are getting upset about these conditions, but I just wanna say – what did you expect? I felt like this added an element of difficulty to the challenge that I found really cool and interesting and a bit of a physical challenge for me to overcome,” he added. “I’m not sure how everyone feels about this, but personally I liked it. I’m not sure what everyone was expecting, did they think they were just going to hand over $4.5 million? No! We were definitely going to have to be put through our paces for it.”</p><p>He continued by saying that he went to bed hungry as the crew neglected to bring him dinner because the filming took so long. A few notable players have been able to make an impression, while hundreds of participants were eliminated before receiving any screen time.</p><p>Jordan continued by saying that he had “a decent amount of time left in the challenge” at the end of the game, indicating that he had advanced to the following round without incident. The one thing he didn’t particularly enjoy, though, was that they skipped supper because the filming took so long.</p><p>“I went into the next day really hungry, but I signed up for this. I knew what I was getting myself into,” the reality star said.</p><p>Jordan said that he saw the casting advertisement at his modeling agency and applied for Squid Game: The Challenge, according to an interview he did this week with Fifi, Fev, and Nick.</p><h3><strong>Jordan Levoux Age</strong></h3><p>At the time of filming the show, Jordan Levoux was 29 years old.</p><h3><strong>Jordan Levoux Family</strong></h3><p>Jordan Levoux is very private but has shared a picture of his mom Tatianja on his Instagram. “Nice little slice of history with my ma last night, how good,” Jordan wrote in March 2022 post.</p><p>Tatianja is available on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.
