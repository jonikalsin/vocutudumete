Since the NBC journalist has not published any pictures from her wedding, it is safe to assume that she is not married.</p><p>It is common knowledge that Jericka has a daughter, despite the fact that she has never discussed her husband in a public setting. Duncan, if you go to her Instagram account, you will be able to see a picture of her daughter there.</p><p>They seem to be getting along just great, as seen by the fact that they smile at each other frequently and take walks together, despite the fact that Duncan appears to be a single mother at the present time. She has not revealed any information regarding the man who is the father of her daughter.</p><p>Jericka and her daughter made a guest appearance on an edition of CBS Mornings. In the brief video, the mother and daughter duo performed a reading from an anti-racism children’s book.</p><p>Later on, when Jericka asked her daughter which part of the book was her favorite, the response she gave was that she did not like how the author dealt with racism. And when Journey responded coherently to the inquiry, articulating her beliefs on anti-racism, Jericka looked at her baby girl with admiration as she spoke her mind.</p><h2><span id=Jericka_Duncan_a_journalist_for_CBS_Talks_About_Her_Boyfriend_Dray_Clark_And_Their_Relationship>Jericka Duncan, a journalist for CBS, Talks About Her Boyfriend Dray Clark And Their Relationship</span></h2><p>It would appear that CBS Journalist Jericka Duncan and her lover Dray Clark are currently in a relationship with each other.
