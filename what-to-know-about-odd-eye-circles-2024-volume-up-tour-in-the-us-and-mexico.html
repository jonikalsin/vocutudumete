It was formed as the second sub-unit of the larger girl group Loona as part of the “Girl of the Month” pre-debut project. Comprising three members – Kim Lip, JinSoul, and Choerry – Odd Eye Circle officially debuted on September 21, 2017, with their EP titled “Mix & Match.”</p><p>The trio gained recognition not only for their musical style but also for their legal dispute with their former label, Blockberry Creative, which they won in January 2023. Following the resolution, they signed exclusive contracts with Modhaus and resumed their activities, releasing their EP “Version Up” in July 2023.</p><h2>Odd Eye Circle Band Members</h2><p><strong>Kim Lip :</strong> One of the members of Odd Eye Circle.</p><p><strong>JinSoul :</strong> Another integral member contributing to the distinct sound and style of Odd Eye Circle.</p><p><strong>Choerry :</strong> Completing the trio, Choerry contributes her talents to the group’s success.</p><h2>Odd Eye Circle Band Albums</h2><p><span></span></p><table><br></table><p>TRENDING</p><p><i>Disclaimer</i>: The above information is for general informational purposes only.
