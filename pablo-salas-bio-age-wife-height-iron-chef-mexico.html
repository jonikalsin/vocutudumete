No wonder, Pablo Salas, who was recognized for his efforts in elevating the Mexican culinary industry by Senator Ricardo Monreal Ávila, joined </span><i><span>Iron Chef: Mexico</span></i><span> “to explore the diversity of formats and ingredients.”</span></p><p><span>Get to know him better as this Pablo Salas Bio proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Pablo Salas On Iron Chef: Mexico</b></h3><p><span>Netflix’s </span><i><span>Iron Chef: Mexico</span></i><span> — </span><i><span>Iron Chef</span></i><span>’s spinoff — premiered on September 21, 2022, and like the original series, it featured six chef challengers including Pablo Salas ready to take on the judges.</span></p><p><span>In case you’re new to the format, the Mexican chefs competed in a studio, each battling the “Iron Chef”. So, the gold was to impress a rotating panel of judges with their cuisine while under immense time pressure to prepare different dishes. Thus, by the end, only one winner remained who was then gifted with a Katana, the long sword associated with the Japanese Samurai.</span></p><p><span>But why Katana? Well, originally the program first aired in Japan in 1993 titled </span><i><span>Ryōri no Tetsujin</span></i><span>, meaning “Ironmen of Cooking”. The series ran for 309 episodes until 2002. Then, it was revived under the new name</span><i><span> Iron Chef</span></i><span> in 2012. It has since spawned numerous regional spin-offs, including this Mexican version.</span></p><p><span>“An honor that a great event like Iron Chef has come to our country 🇲🇽 Thank you@netflixlat. I take with me a great experience and above all learning, a challenge like this makes me recognize and explore the diversity of formats and ingredients, above all, it is a great pride for me that our work is known throughout the world,” Pablo promoted the show on his IG.</span></p><p><span>Joining Pablo for the inaugural season of </span><i><span>Iron Chef: Mexico</span></i><span> were his co-stars — Claudette Zepeda (owner of </span><i><span>Taqueria Zepeda </span></i><span>– a small taco shop in Sydney, Australia), Claudia Albertina Ruiz Sántiz (owner of </span><i><span>Kokonó</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Albertina</span></i><span>), Abel Hernández (owner of </span><i><span>Eloise</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Loretta</span></i><span>), Adria Marina Montaño (owner of two food trucks), Diana Dávila (owner of </span><i><span>Mi Tocaya Antojeria</span></i><span> in Chicago, Illinois), Karen Valadez Burstein (owner of </span><i><span>Casa Valadez</span></i><span> and</span><i><span> La Virgen de la Cueva</span></i><span>), and Francisco Molina (owner of </span><i><span>Evoka </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Casa Bernabé</span></i><span>).</span></p><p><span>As for the judges, the “Iron Chefs” were Francisco Ruano, Roberto Solis, and Gabriela Ruiz.</span></p><p><span>Also, the original Chairman, Mark Dacascos returned for the show that season.</span></p><p><b>Did you know:</b><span> Pablo has also appeared on </span><i><span>Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern</span></i><span> in 2018.</span></p><h3><b>Pablo Salas Career</b></h3><p><span>Pablo Salas says he’s “merely a cook” — a primarily self-taught cook, who later enhanced his culinary skill at </span><i><span>Ambrosía</span></i><span> (probably the best source of culinary education for cooks in Mexico).</span></p><p><span>At </span><i><span>Ambrosía</span></i><span>, Pablo apprenticed under chef Federico López. There, he learned the extensive theories behind cooking. But when he graduated in 2002, he faced the shocking reality that the real-world food industry was“not looking for knowledgeable bachelors in gastronomy,” but rather a ready-made cook.</span></p><p><span>So, hopeless to find a job, Pablo went back to Toluca and started a pastry studio. Eventually, he then bought a restaurant on Calle Francisco Murguía (owned by his friend), and finally, in September 2010, he decided to redefine his cuisine and career — giving birth to </span><i><span>Amaranta</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Now, Pablo’s restaurant is listed as one of the best restaurants in Mexico in various publications.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Besides </span><i><span>Amaranta</span></i><span>, Pablo was also the man behind </span><i><span>Lona Cocina And Tequileria</span></i><span>. This Mexican eatery offered “Salas’ eclectic, soulful Mexican cooking in a chic, yet funky environment, complete with a breathtaking outdoor bar, casually elegant interior dining room, a special tequila tasting room, and multiple private dining spaces.”</span></p><p><span>After his success, Pablo was also appointed delegate of the C</span><i><span>onservatory of Mexican Gastronomic Culture (CCGM)</span></i><span> and given a membership of the </span><i><span>Mexican Cuisine Collective</span></i><span>, where he offered cooking classes through various educative institutions all over Mexico.</span></p><h3><b>Is Pablo Salas On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span>Find him on Instagram at @</span><a href=#><span>pablo_salasc</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, here’s his Facebook @</span><a href=#><span>ChefPabloSalas</span></a><span> and Twitter @</span><a href=#><span>Pablo_SalasC</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Pablo Salas Family</b></h3><p><span>Pablo Salas credits his success to his family of four.</span></p><p><span>Looking back, it was his dad, Francisco, who resigned from his job and sold everything he owned to support Pablo’s decision to buy his friend’s restaurant on Calle Francisco Murguía.</span></p><p><span>Thereafter, Pablo’s mom, Verónica, joined in as the manager, and Pablo’s brother worked there as the sommelier and floor manager.</span></p><p><span>“My mother was the biggest influence on me because she wasn’t a trained chef, but she really loved to cook every day. I saw her cook all the time, always trying new things. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn’t, and I think that’s the way we cook (at </span><i><span>Amaranta</span></i><span>) too,” Pablo recalled.</span></p><h3><b>When Is Pablo Salas Birthday?</b></h3><p><span>Pablo Salas receives his birthday wishes on October 23.</span></p><p><span>As per his birth date, Pablo is of the Scorpio zodiac.</span></p><h3><b>Pablo Salas Age</b></h3><p><span>Pablo Salas was 41 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span>Iron Chef: Mexico</span></i><span> in 2022.</span></p><p><span>Yes! he does look a lot younger though.</span></p><h3><b>Pablo Salas Wife</b></h3><p><span>Pablo Salas didn’t reveal information about his wife or kids.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>How Tall Is Pablo Salas?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Pablo stands tall at a height under 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm).</span></p><p><span>His distinct features include — shaved head and a religious-tattoo coved body.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Pablo Salas From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Pablo proudly bears his origin Mexico.</span></p><p><span>Even as of 2022, he resided in Toluca, Mexico.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>How Much Is Pablo Salas Net Worth?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>In 2022, Pablo flaunted a net worth of above $3 million.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmqZmSobxuv8ClmKxlkp68bq3GnmSwoZaaeqmxyKCfrWWZp7yvecKhnJ9lnZrFqq%2FOaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-about-blue-kimble-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html><span>←</span><span>All About Blue Kimble!
