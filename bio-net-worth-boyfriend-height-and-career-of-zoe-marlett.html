<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Bio, Net worth, Boyfriend, Height And Career Of Zoe Marlett</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Zoe Marlett is a young Canadian actor and voice artist who resides in Vancouver, British Columbia. She became well-known around the world after giving a standout performance as Anna in the Netflix series “Black Summer,” in which she paired up with Jaime King for both of the show’s seasons.</strong></p><p>Karl Schaefer and John Hyams are the show’s creators, and the second season will debut on June 17th, 2021. Rose, a significant character in the show played by Jaime King, is the mother of Zoe’s character. The devoted daughter of Patrick (played by Ty Olsson) and Rose are named Anna.</p><p>John Hyams and Abram Cox were the directors of this young actress. I’ll try to give you a quick biography of Marlett and her rise to stardom on Netflix in this piece.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Zoe_Marlett>What is the Net Worth of Zoe Marlett?</span></h2><p>As of December 2022, Zoe Marlett’s net worth was estimated to be between <strong>$300,000 and USD 350,000.</strong></p><h2><span id=Biography_of_Zoe_Marlett>Biography of Zoe Marlett</span></h2><p>Zoe Marlett was born to adore Canadian parents on <strong>May 8, 2005</strong>, in Vancouver, British Columbia. She is a Taurus, an earth sign, and she is 16 years old as of 2021. However, Zoe’s views on the sun sign do not persuade me.</p><p>Tauruses are seen as being pragmatists, loyal, and patient. Some trustworthy websites claim that their fortunate days are Friday and Monday. She is a Canadian citizen and was born into a family of Christians.</p><p>Christina Marlett, her mother, and Paul Marlett, her father, were both born to this young and beautiful actress with whom she has a strong relationship. Her mother helps her balance her work and schooling, and both of her parents are fully supportive of her acting career.</p><p>On June 15, 2008, Christina and Paul gave birth to Oakley Marlett, Zoe’s younger brother, after waiting three years. The younger sister, Zoe, who has had considerable success at such a young age, is the most down-to-earth of the two.</p><p>She is in the tenth grade and is now pursuing her schooling. On the other hand, Oakley is a seventh-grader. This actress attends her hometown school, according to my sources, but she has never posted the name of the institution online due to privacy concerns.</p><p>I learned that Christina, her mother, is an entrepreneur after perusing her social media profiles. In addition to raising her kids, she also works as a successful company owner, motivational speaker, and coach for self-care.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style=height:100%;width:100%><tbody><tr><td><strong>Real Full Name</strong></td><td><strong>Zoe Marlett.</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Occupation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Voice Artist and Actress.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age (as of 2021)</strong></td><td>16 years.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birthday</strong></td><td>May 8, 2005 (Sunday, Mother’s Day).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Place of Birth</strong></td><td>Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td>White.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>Canadian.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Parents</strong></td><td>Father:&nbsp;Paul Marlett.<br>Mother:&nbsp;Christina Marlett.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td>Brother:&nbsp;Oakley Marlett.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Brown.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Hazel.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height (approx.)</strong></td><td>In feet and inches: 5’ 4”</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight (approx.)</strong></td><td>In Kilograms: 46 Kg</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hobbies</strong></td><td>Karate and Painting.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net worth (as of 2021)</strong></td><td>$300,000 – $350,000 US Dollars, approx.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=How_did_Zoe_Marlett_start_her_Career>How did Zoe Marlett start her Career?</span></h2><p>When she was employed as a voiceover artist at an early age, Zoe’s professional acting career officially got underway.
