<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>In The Upcoming DC Film Black Adam Main Character Will Play As A Antagonists</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The tale of the number one Shazam villain, Black Adam, or Teth-Adam, will be told in DC’s next film, Black Adam. Adam made his comic book début in The Marvel Family #1 and went on to become one of the most recognized adversaries in the DC universe. He was ideally the wizard’s first option for Shazam’s abilities. However, he was imprisoned after abusing them.&nbsp;Adam will not play the part of a villain in the film. The newly released teaser indicated that the character would be an anti-hero, which is consistent with how Adam has depicted his positive side in recent years in the comics.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>The world needed a hero, it got <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#BlackAdam</a>. Only in theaters October 21. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/7OEvjlEVes</a></p><p>— DC (@DCComics) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">June 8, 2022</a></p><h2>Black Adam’s main antagonist</h2><p>The latest teaser teased the primary narrative, but fans are most enthusiastic about Sabbac, the main antagonist.&nbsp;In the DC world, there are two Sabbacs. In Shazam Jr.’s narrative, Timothy Karnes was a stunning friend-turned-foe villain. However, this version of the character was not utilized in the film by the authors. Instead, they’ve gone with the second Sabbac, Ishmael Gregor.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Black-Adam-1.jpg alt="Black Adam" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Outsiders (vol. 3) #8 introduced Gregor as a Russian immigrant who became a mafia lord in New York City. He proved to be a much bigger nuisance for the Shazams, since he was far more malevolent than the original Sabbac.&nbsp;Gregor hired his men to hunt Karnes because he envied his authority. He then removed Karnes’ voice box, preventing him from saying the word ‘Sabbac,’ which was the catalyst for his transformation into Sabbac. He then conducted a demonic ceremony that murdered Karnes and bestowed him with his abilities.</p><p>We believe the makers of Black Adam picked Ishmael Gregor over Timothy Karnes because of his mafia leader persona. Gregor may possibly be the boss of Intergang, a criminal organization from Metropolis, according to several fan theories. And, based on the trailer, it seems like the notion may have been realized.</p><h2>Intergang: A Closer Look</h2><p>In the comics, Intergang is most known for his fights with Metropolis’ superhero, Superman. However, the group has a special bond with Black Adam since they presented him to the love of his life, Adrianna Tomaz.&nbsp;Tomaz was a refugee from Egypt who was enslaved by Intergang. To earn Adam’s backing, the gang attempted to exchange Tomaz as a present. However, Adam’s plan backfired when he protected her from the gang by shooting every member in front of him.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Black-Adam-2.jpg alt="Black Adam" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Tomaz also lets Adam see how much good he can do for the world, which ultimately leads to his change of heart. The teaser also revealed that Tomaz would appear in the film. So we may anticipate the sequence in which Adam saves her life to play out again, this time on the big screen.&nbsp;The film will be released in theaters on October 21, 2022, and it will star some notable figures in the business. Everyone is enthusiastic about Dwayne Johnson’s Black Adam, but other characters like Pierce Brosnan’s Doctor Fate, Noah Centineo’s Atom Smasher, and Aldis Hodge’s Hawkman deserve equal attention.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigp2WknbJuwc%2Bcpqahnpx6pa%2BMn6ClpV2XuaKvymaYnZmdYrqitc1mmqGZopawtbHRZq6ipJxiva2t2GaYrGWRYq6vwMCgpqeho6nAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-did-robert-baratheon-die-in-game-of-thrones-what-killed-robert-baratheon.html><span>←</span><span>How did Robert Baratheon die in Game of Thrones?
