The first verse speaks of the singer's faith and love being set on God and how His blood and grace have taken away their shame. The chorus is a declaration of being made new by Jesus and is repeated at the end of the song. The second verse speaks of how the singer puts their trust in God and declares that choosing His way, truth, and life is everything. The bridge of the song declares the singer's freedom in Christ and how they have been changed and given new life.</p><br><p>The song speaks about the joy and peace that comes with finding renewed hope and faith in God. It is essentially a reminder that no matter how far someone may have strayed, there is always an opportunity to start anew and follow the right path. Draylin's strong voice adds to the powerful message conveyed in the song.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>My Faith, My Love</u><br>My belief and affection</p><br><p><u>Is set on you</u><br>Are focused on you</p><br><p><u>My God, You are enough</u><br>You are all that I need, God</p><br><p><u>Your Blood, Your Grace</u><br>Your sacrifice and favor</p><br><p><u>Has taken all my shame</u><br>Has removed all my guilt and wrongdoing</p><br><p><u>My Heart is fixed on you</u><br>My emotions are steadfastly centered on you</p><br><p><u>I will leave behind</u><br>I will abandon</p><br><p><u>The mistakes I've made</u><br>The errors and faults I have committed</p><br><p><u>I am running to your grace</u><br>I am seeking your unmerited favor</p><br><p><u>I will lift my eyes</u><br>I will look upward</p><br><p><u>With my hands up to the sky</u><br>With my arms raised to the heavens</p><br><p><u>I am chasing after you</u><br>I am pursuing you relentlessly</p><br><p><u>Cause you're making me new</u><br>Because you are transforming me</p><br><p><u>Oh oh, Oh oh</u><br>Vocables</p><br><p><u>Jesus, it's You</u><br>It is you, Jesus</p><br><p><u>Your Nail scarred hands</u><br>Your hands pierced by nails</p><br><p><u>Have broken every chain</u><br>Have shattered every bond and restraint</p><br><p><u>I put my trust in you</u><br>I rely on you</p><br><p><u>This Way, This Truth</u><br>This path, this reality</p><br><p><u>This life that I choose</u><br>This existence that I opt for</p><br><p><u>Is You, Is You (Jesus)</u><br>Is You, it is you (Jesus)</p><br><p><u>I was lost</u><br>I was bewildered</p><br><p><u>Now I'm found</u><br>Now I am discovered</p><br><p><u>And I stand on higher ground</u><br>And I am elevated</p><br><p><u>I declare I've been changed by you</u><br>I affirm that I have been transformed by you</p><br><p><u>And I was bound</u><br>And I was constrained</p><br><p><u>Now I'm free</u><br>Now I am liberated</p><br><p><u>And your spirit lives in me</u><br>And your divine essence resides within me</p><br><p><u>I declare I'm alive in you</u><br>I profess that I exist in you</p><br><p><u>And on that day you call me away</u><br>And on that day you summon me</p><br><p><u>I'll walk on streets of gold</u><br>I will step on roads of gold</p><br><p><u>And I'll hear a choir of every angel sing</u><br>And I will listen to a chorus of all angels singing</p><br><p><u>Holy is the Lord, holy is the Lord</u><br>The Lord is holy, the Lord is holy</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Contributed by Elena G.
