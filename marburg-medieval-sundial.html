Teichner also noted, in an interview with German outlet Hessens Chau, that the find is a rare one, as there aren’t many of these medieval wooden sundials left.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-446979 alt="18th Century German Sundial" width=576 height=729 data-sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/18th-century-german-sundial.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-446979 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Science Museum Group</span><span class=caption-body>An example of a wooden German pocket sundial from circa 1776 – 1800.</span></p><p>As <a href=# rel=noopener>The Science Times</a> explains, sundials have been made since at least 1500 B.C.E., when they were first developed in China, Babylon, and Egypt. Before long, sundials abounded in both public and private spaces, and people in Europe were carrying pocket sundials by the 17th century.</p><p>These sundials had a very simple design. By using a flat plate and a gnomon, which casts a shadow on the plate, people could determine how high or low the sun was in the sky, which informed them of the time of day.</p><p>Thus, it’s easy to imagine how the sundial found in Marburg may have been used during medieval times. Tucked in someone’s pocket, it would have been withdrawn on occasion to check the shadow cast by the gnomon and used to verify the time of day.</p><p>Still, some questions about the medieval sundial remain.</p><p>For starters, Teichner and his students aren’t entirely sure why the sundial was found where they found it. As he explained to Hessens Chau, their excavations have lately focused on an area of the church which people once used as a place to discard waste. The sundial isn’t the only thing they’ve found there, and the other items will require further examination.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-446987 alt="Marburg Germany" width=900 height=536 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/marburg-germany.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-446987 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>PhilippN/Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The town of Marburg, Germany, where the 16th-century wooden sundial was found during excavations at a church.</span></p><p>“We’re digging here at the monastery’s probable rubbish dump,” he said, “and are pulling up much that we need to examine first to identify.”</p><p>Though there’s still more to learn about the sundial, it’s certainly an evocative discovery. Just like people today flick their wrist to check their watch, or pull up their phone to check the time, someone hundreds of years ago reached into their pocket to check their sundial.</p><p>Positioning it against the sun, they would have studied the shadow, determined the time, and continued on their day.</p><p>After reading about the handheld medieval sundial discovered in Germany, see how archaeologists in Germany came across a <a href=#>1,400-year-old headless horse</a>, alongside its rider, amid a gravesite in Knittlingen.
