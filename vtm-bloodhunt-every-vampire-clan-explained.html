These are based on the clans from the original tabletop game, and more are expected to be added in <a href=#>the full version of Bloodhunt</a>.</p><p>In the lore of&nbsp;Vampire: The Masquerade,&nbsp;a vampire’s clan is the same as that of whoever turned them. Each of the clans has its own special abilities and weaknesses. One example of this is the Nosferatu, who gain vampire disciplines that allow them to turn invisible and communicate with animals, but their appearance is transformed into that of a hideous monster.</p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><span class="next-single related-single">Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Vampire The Masquerade: What Your Favorite Bloodlines Clan Says About You</a></span></p><p>In&nbsp;Bloodhunt,&nbsp;each clan has two different classes, but they both share a clan skill related to movement. Each archetype has a shared clan skill, along with an individual passive skill and archetype skill. The&nbsp;<a href=#>Bloodhunt&nbsp;alpha contained three clans</a> with two classes a piece, and they each possessed unique powers that drastically alter their playstyle.</p><h2>Bloodhunt’s Clan Brujah</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Clan Brujah has two archetypes –&nbsp;Brute and Vandal. Their clan skill allows them to perform a huge leap. This is especially useful in a game like&nbsp;Bloodhunt,&nbsp;as the game’s current map has a lot of verticality, and the ability to instantly escape onto a rooftop is a huge asset to the Brujah clan. The Brute’s passive skill restores up to 50% of their max health when they aren’t being damaged, while their class skill sends out an energy shockwave that can block enemy projectiles. The Vandal’s passive skill reduces the damage they take from close-ranged attacks from enemies, while their class skill allows them to punch the ground and create a shockwave that sends opponents flying back into the air.</p><h2>Bloodhunt’s Clan Nosferatu</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Clan Nosferatu has two archetypes – Prowler and Saboteur. This <a href=#>favorite monstrous&nbsp;Vampire clan</a> has class skills that allow them to turn invisible for a few seconds. The Prowler’s passive shows a red trail in the air that only they can see, which leads to other players that have been wounded. Their class skill creates bats that scout an area and reveal the position of enemies nearby, by showing their outline through walls. The Saboteur’s passive skill allows them to turn semi-invisible after crouching, while their class skill allows them to create a poison gas mine that deals damage over time.</p><h2>Bloodhunt’s Clan Toreador</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Clan Toreador has two archetypes – Muse and Siren. Their clan skill allows them to project an illusionary image ahead of them, which they can perform a short-range teleport to, or use as a feint. The Muse’s passive skill refreshes their active cooldowns, allowing them to use their class abilities straight away, while their technical skill acts as a healing regeneration aura that restores the Muse and any nearby allies.&nbsp;The Siren’s passive skill allows them to charm mortals on the map, making it easier to feed on them and potentially&nbsp;<a href=#>avoiding penalties for&nbsp;breaking&nbsp;the Masquerade</a> in their presence. Their class skill can temporarily blind opponents, leaving them helpless.</p><h2>The Ventrue Clan Is Coming To Bloodhunt</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Developer Sharkmob has revealed that the first clan to be added to&nbsp;Bloodhunt&nbsp;is Clan Ventrue. In&nbsp;Vampire: The Masquerade, Clan Ventrue is referred to as the Clan of Kings, as they often hold high positions in Kindred society. Not every new Ventrue is given a seat in the boardroom, however, and many have to prove their value through service to their elders, before being given a chance to wield power. In&nbsp;Bloodhunt, it’s likely that the Ventrue characters will have class powers based on the Dominate and Fortitude disciplines. Dominate would likely allow the player to control the NPCs who hang out on the map and Fortitude would make them more resistant to damage.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong E3 Trailer Shows New Playable Character</a></span></p><p><strong>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt&nbsp;</strong>is currently in development for PC and consoles, with a Q3/Q4 2021 release window.</p><p><strong><span class=next-btn-text-title>Elden Ring’s Armor Sets Repeat A Terrible RPG Trope</span></strong></p><p><strong class=section-sub-title>About The Author</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/eUY03dK.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><strong class=bio-title><br>Scott Baird<br><span class=amount>(2433 Articles Published)</span><br></strong><p>Scott has been writing for Screen Rant since 2016 and regularly contributes to The Gamer.
