My stroke may have happened,” she told Billboard.</p><p>She revealed to ET Canada later in 2019 that she has high blood pressure, kidney problems, and lupus, which are the main causes of her health concerns. And that’s when I began to notice the body image issues. It combines all of them. I will need to take this drug for the remainder of my life. To be honest, it depends on the month. When people started criticizing me for [my weight], I became aware of it. And that’s simply my reality, to be honest. I change throughout. Depending on what’s going on in my life.
