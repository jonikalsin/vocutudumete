Then they hear hissing,” Bozzi told ABC News.</p><p>Bozzi’s family knew the noise was coming from the bushes in a neighbor’s yard.</p><p>“My daughter came and got me. I couldn’t really see it, so I got close up on it, and he backed up a little bit, and I was like ‘he’s kind of big,'” Bozzi said after coming face-to-face with the alligator.</p><p>The father jumped into action immediately.</p><p>“I was gonna put my shoes on. I had flip-flops on; everybody’s making fun of me (for that),” Bozzi said.</p><p>That’s right – Bozzi went toe-to-toe with an angry alligator…in flip-flops.</p><p>And he was armed with the best thing he could find.</p><p>“Let me get the trash can!” he said.</p><p>It was a showdown between a gator, a guy and a garbage can.</p><p>With the trash can, Bozzi was able to back the gator up. He flipped up the can’s lid and waited for the alligator to approach.</p><p>Once the alligator’s head entered the trash can, Bozzi flipped the lid down.</p><p>“I got him,” Bozzi said.</p><p>The North Philly native, still in flip-flops, walked the gator across the street and down the hill.</p><p>He eventually rolled the trash can to the edge of the water, quickly dropped it and ran away. The gator slowly made its way out of the trash can.</p><p>Bozzi returned and pushed the can, which gave the alligator a nudge to get into the water. He then grabbed his trash can back.</p><p>Bozzi said that’s the one moment where he was truly scared.</p><p>“When I got down to the hill, I thought ‘if I’m dropping him off, there might be three more in the bushes,'” Bozzi said with a laugh.</p><p>His neighbors and many of the millions who have seen the now viral video have called Bozzi a hero. But he’s just happy no one was hurt – gator included.</p><p>“I love all animals. I don’t care how vicious they are, how heavy they are, how small they are; we’re connected somehow. We’re on this planet. I think it was my duty to protect everybody and the animal came out alright,” Bozzi said.</p><p>Bozzi has only lived in Florida for a year.</p><p>He said next time, he’ll probably call animal control to handle any grumpy gators in the neighborhood.</p><p>Copyright © 2021 WLS-TV.
