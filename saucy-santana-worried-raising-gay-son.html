And not because nothing is wrong with it but because of everything I went through. I don’t look at it as self-hate because I love myself more than anybody.”</p><p>He continued: “I think that it’s just not easy. I want better and I don’t even know if better is the right word because it’s not saying… To me, nothing is wrong with being gay.”</p><p>The full interview arrives December 15 but you can check out the preview below:</p><p>Back in October, Saucy Santana and Akademiks had quite the blow-out that resulted in the former making a diss record, <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>“Meet Me In The Streets.”</a>&nbsp;It ignited after <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Akademiks made a number of negative comments about the City Girls</a>, calling them “non-talented” and claiming their musical buzz had “fizzled out.”</p><p>Santana, who is friends with the Florida duo, took issue with the comments before Ak hit back with a homophobic rant: “Everybody know I’m cool with the LGBT community, but no batty man like Saucy Santana could talk to me. I’ll spit in your face, n-gga. Me and you couldn’t have a conversation. You’re a cocksucker. We don’t talk to n-ggas like you.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/05/nle-choppa-thirst-traps-have-saucy-santana-feeling-a-type-of-way-250x142.jpg alt="NLE Choppa’s Thirst Traps Have Saucy Santana Feeling A Type Of Way" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>NLE Choppa’s Thirst Traps Have Saucy Santana Feeling A Type Of Way</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>May 22, 2023</p></a><p>“You need to go get right with God. Go look in that mirror and figure out what the fuck going on with yourself,” he added. “We ain’t indicting people who are homosexuals, but a n-gga like you, you got a mental illness, my boy. You trying to mix it up with a n-gga like me.”</p><p><a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Santana responded by threatening to assault and rape Akademiks</a>: “After I beat you, I’ma fuck you in your ass because you’re a bitch-ass n-gga. That’s what we do to you. You always pressing a BBL, f-g. Bitch, you sitting on your thick-ass. Bitch, I got a BBL and you got a BBW.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>The rape threat resulted in Akademiks crying during a Rumble stream</a> and saying: “I’m not tryna get canceled to fuck up what we got going on. I’m never tryna get canceled saying the wrong thing — I know what we got going on, I love it. I’m trying not to get canceled.</p><p>“But this shit does bother me. Put it like this: with everything we’ve talked about, I’ve never cared about — I don’t care what rapper got at me, bro. Ever. But really, there’s certain shit I really don’t fuck with in my life that I will never do.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0miqmq2Trnq0rc2tmKeZXay8s77InptmqpGewKq6xmaemrFdqLyv</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rhoc-david-beador-is-starting-a-new-family-with-his-fiancee-and-his-ex-wife-shannon-is-reportedly-shocked-415253.html><span>←</span><span>RHOC David Beador Is Starting A New Family With His Fiance, And His Ex-Wife Shannon Is Reporte</span></a>
