Known by many as the most successful high school football coach in the state, Taraska’s journey from player to mentor is a testament to his passion for the game, his dedication to his students, and his unwavering commitment to excellence.</p><p>Tom Taraska’s journey into coaching and mentoring teenagers began with a strong foundation in athletics. After graduating from UW-Oshkosh with an education degree, he embarked on his coaching and teaching career at Franklin High School. This initial step into the world of education and athletics set the stage for a remarkable career that would leave an indelible mark on the lives of countless young athletes.</p><p>Over the course of seven years at Franklin High School, Taraska honed his coaching skills and developed a profound understanding of the dynamics involved in guiding and inspiring teenagers. It was a time of growth and learning, both for Taraska and the students under his guidance.&nbsp;In 1982, Taraska took a significant step forward in his coaching career when he accepted a position at Hartland’s Arrowhead High School. It was here that he would make his lasting mark and build a legacy that would transcend the boundaries of the football field.</p><p>Taraska completed his 26th season as the head football coach at Arrowhead High School in 2007. During his tenure, he achieved remarkable success, which included four WIAA Division 1 state championship teams (in 1993, 1994, 1996, and 2007). These achievements were a testament to Taraska’s coaching acumen and his ability to motivate and mold young athletes into champions.&nbsp;Beyond the state championships, Taraska’s coaching record boasted four WIAA Division 1 state runner-up titles (in 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2006), a state-record 39 postseason victories, three undefeated and nationally ranked teams, and an overall record that most coaches can only dream of attaining—233 wins against 91 losses.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKyfonq1rdGaqqSZXaSvqsDUmqmyZZGnv7DDx56YnWWYnrSpedKcn6innGKwsK3CoWSwmaWgsrS0wGamm6Gkqq6zxY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./frank-zane.html><span>←</span><span>Frank Zane</span></a>
