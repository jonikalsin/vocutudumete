Caban, 36, took to Instagram to share a picture of her and Mars in character as the iconic fictional household that dates back to the 1930s.
Caban channeled Wednesday in her trademark black dress, white collar, and dark twin braids. The “Uptown Funk” chose to go as Wednesday’s brother, Pugsley, who is known for wearing striped shirts similar to the one Mars had on."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The “Finesse” singer was taking a break from his ongoing world tour when paparazzi took photos of him with a fuller figure and a protruding belly.</p><p class=dh>Mars didn’t seem to be hiding his figure anyway since he was shirtless and donned only patterned beach shorts.

Mars’ heart-wrenching ballad “When I Was Your Man” is also said to be about Caban.</p><p class=dh>Despite their love story, Mars and Caban are not likely to be walking down the aisle anytime soon.
