<a href=../../../list-of-pok-c3-a9mon-with-released-hidden-abilities-generation-v.html></a>
From Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia.
This is a list of Pokémon that includes all Pokémon that can legitimately have their Hidden Abilities. When breeding, if a female Pokémon with a Hidden Ability breeds with a male Pokémon in a compatible Egg Group, the offspring will have a 60% chance of also having the Hidden Ability; the Ability cannot be passed on if Ditto is a parent in this generation. While Metapod, Flygon, Starly, and other similar Pokémon do not have a Hidden Ability that differs from the regular Ability, at least one of their evolutionary relatives do have one; therefore, they are included on this list.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>NF's HOPE Album Release Date: Get Ready for NF's Highly-Anticipated Album</h2><time>Jun 30, 2024</time>
