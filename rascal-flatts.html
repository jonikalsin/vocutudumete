Gary LeVox and Jay DeMarcus are second cousins from a musical family. DeMarcus moved to Nashville in 1992, earning his first record deal as part of a Christian group called East to West; his brother-in-law, James Otto, is also a country music singer. In 1997, DeMarcus called LeVox and convinced him to come to Nashville and provide some harmonies on Michael English’s album Gospel, which he was producing. They engineered the album together and became an English backup band.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-913 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Rascal Flatts released more than forty singles, sixteen of which reached number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs, Country Airplay, and Canada Country charts. Their longest-lasting number-one single, a cover of Marcus Hummon’s “Bless the Broken Road”, spent five weeks in that position in 2005. Through 2006–07, “What Hurts the Most” was number one on both the Hot Country Songs and Adult Contemporary charts, and their highest peak on the Billboard Hot 100 at number six. The band also had commercial success with a cover of Tom Cochrane’s “Life Is a Highway”, which they recorded for the soundtrack of the Pixar animated movie Cars. Their music is defined by country-pop influences. In addition to their own songs, DeMarcus has produced albums for Chicago, Jennette McCurdy, and Brooks & Dunn member Kix Brooks.</p><p>On January 7, 2020, Rascal Flatts announced that they would be disbanding following a farewell tour after 22 years together. However, this farewell tour was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic; the group’s disbandment was not officially confirmed until October 2021.</p><p>On April 27, 2021, DeMarcus stated in an interview with Taste of Country that the pandemic may have altered the band’s plans for a farewell tour and that they may stay together and perform 10-15 concerts annually. DeMarcus and Rooney appeared at the 2021 Academy of Country Music Honors show on August 25 to receive the Cliffie Stone Icon Award on behalf of the group, though LeVox was neither present nor mentioned. In October, LeVox revealed that the band decided to break up officially, citing that Rooney had quit. LeVox also revealed he had not spoken to Rooney since his DUI arrest on September 10 and that the band quietly disbanded after the cancellation of their farewell tour.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><h2 id=block-b2e911fa-028d-4d0c-aa12-c89061d1d180>Frequently Asked Questions About Rascal Flatts</h2><strong class=schema-faq-question>Who is Rascal?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Rascal Flatts is an American country music band founded in 1999.
