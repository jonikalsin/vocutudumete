She joined the cast of the series in 2013, and continuing to appear in it, she has gained exposure in the media, and so attracted more fans. Many people admire Cooper for her racing skills, but she remains humble about it. In one interview, Precious said “Before I get behind the wheel, I am a lady. I’m actually kinda shy, quiet…don’t hardly talk at all. But once I get into the race truck, it’s over with. I get into beast mode. I tunnel out, tunnel vision the whole way.

He was reportedly working as a mechanic for Honda when one of the scenes involving the import racing was taking off. Having worked on a Honda Civic hatchback, he joined a race in Virginia, and speaking about that event said “So, it just made sense that I give it a shot. Racers were laughing when they found out I was from Oklahoma. We were asked questions like ‘do we still ride in wagons’ and ‘do we ride horses to work? I answered their questions when I was number two qualifier at the first professional race I entered.” One of the well kept secrets of the series is a rumor regarding Big Chief, Justin Shearer, and his alleged struggles with some sort of substance.
