The relationship lasted for three years. Singh, who has since divorced, simply told the outlet "no comment." According to Page Six, Fiebig identified multiple emails that led to the discovery of the affair in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>TJ Holmes’ wife was reportedly<a href=#> "blindsided"</a> by his alleged affair with his co-anchor Amy Robach, an insider told Page Six. The outlet further revealed that Holmes and his wife, Marilee Fiebig, had been separated for six months but were trying to “work things out” when news of his romance with Robach broke on Wednesday, December 30. “She’s devastated. She had no idea,” the source said.“They haven’t been together in [a while], but they were trying to work it out. They were just together for TJ’s birthday,” which was on August 19. The source claimed that although Fiebig hasn't been wearing her wedding ring, the now-separated pair were making efforts to patch things up.</p><p>Due to the news regarding their alleged affair and his relationship with Singh, Holmes and Robach were both removed from the air on Monday, December 5. A source told Page Six, "TJ's cheating with ABC staffers was definitely one of the reasons why they were yanked off. It has become a distraction." The insider told, "He’s also a d—k to producers. No one likes working with him. He yells and has the biggest ego." During an internal phone call on Monday, ABC News President Kim Godwin shared that the two will no longer anchor the regular 1.00 pm broadcast. In the call, Godwin reportedly complained to staff that the alleged affair had become an "internal and external distraction" and that the GMA brand was being questioned.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRon52WenR5x6iqrWWkn3qpu8umnKxlk52yosDEnWSwoaSderSx1Z6pmqRdrLyusc1mmK1lkZew</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carolina-bree-franks-obituary.html><span>←</span><span>Tragic News!
