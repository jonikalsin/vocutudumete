A sign memorializing Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African-American boy who was brutally lynched in Mississippi in 1955, has been vandalized once again.
This most recent vandalism marks the third time that the sign has been defaced since it was put in place in 2007 by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, a museum dedicated to Till’s story."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The teenager had traveled from Chicago to Mississippi to visit his great uncle and after he arrived, he entered a local market. A white woman, Carolyn Bryant, who owned the store with her husband, Roy, claimed that Till wolf-whistled at her.</p><p>Four days later, Roy and his half-brother, J.W. Milam, kidnapped Till from his bed, savagely beat him, and then shot him in the head. To dispose of his body, the men attached a 75-pound cotton gin fan to his neck with barbed wire and threw his body into the river.</p><p>The two men stood trial for Till’s murder a month later. There were eyewitnesses who saw them and the two men even admitted that they had kidnapped Till, but an all-white jury cleared them of the murder that they later confessed to.</p><p>Furthermore, Carolyn Bryant eventually <a href=# rel=noopener>admitted that she lied</a> about Till’s alleged wolf-whistle in the first place.</p><p>Till’s mother insisted that her son’s body be returned to Chicago and held an open-casket funeral so that the world would be forced to see the brutality of her son’s death. The photos were published in Jet magazine and Till’s death became an important moment in the early days of the civil rights movement.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-185295 alt="Emmett Till" width=900 height=477 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/emmett-till.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-185295 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Scott Olson/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>A man views photographs from the funeral of Emmett Till at the Chicago Historical Society.</span></p><p>The Emmett Till Interpretive Center built the memorial sign for Till as a way to remember the boy who was falsely accused and brutally killed because of racism. According to its website, the Interpretive Center is focusing on how it can <a href=# rel=noopener>move forward</a> from the vandalism and help protect Till’s memory.</p><p>They are currently raising money to create a park and memorial site for Till along the river with increased security, and the National Parks Service is also looking into buying some of the sites associated with Till to create a civil rights park in the Mississippi Delta.</p><p>“We are deeply saddened by this ignorant act,” read a statement on the vandalism from the Emmett Till Interpretive Center. “But we know acts of hate will lead to acts of generosity and love.”</p><p>Next, see the most powerful <a href=#>photos taken during the civil rights movement</a>.
