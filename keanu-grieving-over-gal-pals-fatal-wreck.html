He and Jennifer were extremely close.”</p><p>The actor learned of the accident, which occurred Monday at 6:20 a.m., in a gut-wrenching phone call from Syme’s sobbing mom.</p><p>Reeves then called the coroner’s office and offered to come in and identify the body, police said.</p><p>But they told him it wasn’t necessary because they had already made the identification with a driver’s license.</p><p>In late 1999, Reeves boasted to pals how he was about to become a father for the first time. But shortly before the January 2000 due date, an ultrasound test showed the fetus had died.</p><p>“Jennifer had become alarmed when she had not felt the baby move for several days, and so they rushed her to the hospital,” a source told Splash News, which broke the news of the accident.</p><p>“Keanu was right by her side all the way through the ordeal. He held her hand and they both cried.”</p><p>They buried the baby in a Los Angeles cemetery, and Syme was placed under a doctor’s care.</p><p>She was once an assistant to filmmaker David Lynch, who made “Blue Velvet” and “The Straight Story,” and was also an aide to shock-rocker Marilyn Manson.</p><p>She met Reeves at a Hollywood party promoting his rock band, Dogstar.</p><p>Reeves is no stranger to driving horrors. He’s had several motorcycle accidents, suffering a broken ankle and ruptured spleen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfXJ7j21maW1foLKiutRmnquhlau2r7OMqK2eql2crq15z5qjrGWWlsGiuIywqZ6bm2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./india-summer.html><span>←</span><span>India Summer</span></a>
