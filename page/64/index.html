<a href=../../bad-religion-american-jesus-andy-wallace-mix-lyrics.html></a>
I don’t need to be a global citizen,
‘Cuz I’m blessed by nationality.
I’m member of a growing populace,
We enforce our popularity.
There are things that seem to pull us under and,
There are things that drag us down.
But there’s a power and a vital presence,
It’s lurking all around.
We’ve got the American Jesus,
See him on the interstate.
We’ve got the American Jesus,
He helped build the President’s estate.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Boosie Badazz Disses NBA YoungBoy On New Track!!</h2><time>May 1, 2024</time>
