After the teacher took the student’s phone, the latter was pepper-sprayed by the former. The video was submitted by a Reddit user named @Lazy_Mouse3803, who said that the student was “texting and Googling answers for her school work” when the teacher took her phone away. The commenter also mentioned that this was the second occasion a student had physically hurt a teacher. When a different student was discovered cheating two months prior, the same teacher was hit in the face after taking away the student’s phone. The user claimed that at this Antioch high school, instances like these were frequent.</p><p>The student in question is an adult, according to the exchange depicted in the post. Indignant internet users said that she “straight up assaulted” the faculty member in response to the news. The treatment of the teachers at Antioch High School appalled internet users as the video gained popularity. Many people discussed ways to support instructors while also limiting the number of students who bring their phones to school. Cybernauts also questioned if the student was allowed to bring pepper spray to class. They said that she would be responsible for the teacher’s repercussions if she used it if she was deemed mature enough to do so.</p><p>Despite not being fatal, pepper sprays can be harmful. They are marketed as aerosols that can be used to defend oneself from attackers. They contain an inflammatory compound called capsaicin in the form of oil, claims Medical News Today. The compound capsaicin is what gives chilli peppers their distinctive spiciness. It causes burning, agony, and tearing when it gets into the eyes. It is harmful since it can also result in temporary blindness, wheezing, shortness of breath, fear, skin blisters or burns, dizziness, and loss of consciousness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGirp2Wkmq6ktMSrZKCdpKm2r7OMqZypqJWnerS80Zqwnpxdl8Zuv9Oum56mpGK5pq3VnqpmppWptruxzaxkqK2kp66oscNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rakul-preet-singh.html><span>←</span><span>Rakul Preet Singh</span></a>
