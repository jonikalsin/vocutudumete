He was my first real rock star that dipped his d*** and it was unbelievable.</p><p>“We were the groupies that got to the hotel first and we were the only groupies in Jimi Hendrix’s room. It wasn’t our very first cast. I had tried it on a few civilians first to be ready for Jimi.</p><p>“He’s my biggest. No, he’s not my biggest. There are ‘bigger-ish’ others. But, I couldn’t say whether or not he’s my most exciting. Because they’re my sweet babies and I am their mama and I’m very democratic with all my babies. I don’t like to play favourites. I love them all. The experiences were equally exciting and weird and different from each other.”</p><p>Cynthia was honoured in the song ‘Plaster Caster’ that featured on the 1977 KISS album ‘Love Gun’ although rock legend Gene Simmons was never one of her subjects.</p><p>It included the lyrics: “The plaster’s gettin’ harder and my love is perfection/ A token of my love for her collection.”</p><p>Cynthia’s career was immortalised in the 2001 documentary ‘Plaster Caster’ and she also featured in the 2005 BBC documentary ‘My Penis and I’ – created by the filmmaker Lawrence Barraclough about his anxiety over the size of his penis.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOnLCnrJierm68y5qqrZ2iYrCiv9OeqWacmZrAbq3Gnptmb2Rk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-is-tiger-woods-not-playing-in-the-masters.html><span>←</span><span>Why is Tiger Woods not playing in the Masters?</span></a>
