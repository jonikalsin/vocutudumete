He became known for his amazing career in car racing especially when he won the Daytona 500 three times.</p><p>So how much is Jarrett’s net worth? As of mid 2016, it is estimated by authoritative sources to be $35 million acquired from his years being a race car driver and a sports broadcaster.</p><h3>Dale Jarrett Net Worth $35 million</h3><p>Born in Conover, North Carolina USA, Jarrett is the son of Martha and Ned. Jarrett’s father was a well-known race car driver, competing in the NASCAR Grand National Division from 1953 to 1966. With his father’s legacy it was no surprise that Jarrett ended up with the same career.</p><p>Before Jarrett became a well-known race car driver, he was first a great golfer. During his time in Newton-Conver High School, he played golf, football, baseball and basketball, and became so good in golf that he was named the athlete of the year before his matriculation. Jarrett was also offered a full scholarship to the University of South Carolina to play golf, but he declined to pursue another career.</p><p>Instead, he worked at Hickory Motor Speedway, where his father used to work. After two years, in 1977 he became a professional race car driver, and joined in the Limited Sportsman Division at Hickory. Although he didn’t immediately win, it became the start of his long career in car racing, and his fame and net worth increased tremendously.</p><p>After almost 30 years in the business, Jarrett became a sought-after figure in the world of NASCAR. Some of the highlights of his career include winning the Daytona 500 three times, in 1993, 1996 and lastly in 2000. He also won the Brickyard 400, the Coca-Cola 600, the Budweiser Shootout and the Winston 500. All of his accolades and wins added an immense amount to his wealth and made him very famous.</p><p>In total, Jarrett participated in 668 races in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and 329 races in the NASCAR Nationwide series. In 2008 he decided to retire and finally leave the world of professional race car driving.</p><p>In 2007, Jarrett joined ESPN/ABC to be one of its announcers in a number of Nationwide Series races, and after retiring in 2008, Jarrett decided to dive into the world of mass media and became part of the television network ESPN. He was assigned to be the lead racing analyst, taking over for <a href=#>Rusty Wallace</a>. Today, Jarrett is part of the NBC Sports Broadcasting Crew covering the events of NASCAR.</p><p>In 2014, only six years after his retirement, Jarrett was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame for his outstanding performances in the business.</p><p>Jarrett may have retired racing but he is still in love with the sport. He now owns a dealership in Indian Trail North Carolina, and also started a fantasy sports website named Pay the Fan; both endeavours have helped him sustain his wealth. He also started a foundation in 2002 called the Dale Jarrett Foundation, helping families and children in need.</p><p>In terms of Jarrett’s personal life, he was married to Kelley whom he met in 1977 before he became big in the race car industry. The couple have four children, but have now divorced.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=9.3978494623656><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Dale Jarrett</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$35 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 26, 1956</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Conover, North Carolina, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.82 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Race car driver</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Newton-Conover High School, University of South Carolina</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Ex-spouse Kelley Jarrett</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Jason Jarrett, Natalee Jarrett, Karsyn Jarrett</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Ned Jarrett</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Glenn Jarrett, Patty Makar</td></tr><tr readability=0.35555555555556><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/daleajarrett</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/dalejarrett</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1756045</a></td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Best Driver ESPY Award</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>TV Shows</td><td>NASCAR on ESPN, NASCAR America</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=8.314629258517><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Is an avid golfer and frequently partners with professional golfer 'Phil Mickelson' for charity golf events.</td></tr><tr readability=2.6440677966102><td>2</td><td>First driver to ever win Daytona 500 and Brickyard 400 in the same year (1996).
