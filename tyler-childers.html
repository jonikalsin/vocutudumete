Tyler Childers Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴&nbsp;&nbsp;Line by Line Meaning ↴In a small corner bar he sits there a-drinkin'
Lost as a ball in a field full of corn
Further away than he ever imagined
That he'd ever end up from the place he was bornNow no more forlorn as the Creeker drank whiskey
Than the one that you see outside of your eye
Drinkin' alone as he looks out the window At all of the strangers on the corner outsideHe'd rather be dead"><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

He spends his evenings in a corner bar, drinking whiskey and watching the people outside, feeling disconnected from them and the city they call home. He cannot seem to find his place in this new environment, and the loneliness and isolation he feels are palpable in the lyrics.</p><br><p>Childers draws a parallel between the singer's isolation and the struggles of other men in the city. Some turn to drugs or women to fill the void, while others find solace in drinking alone in a bar. The city, with all its noise and chaos, can be overwhelming for a country boy like the Creeker. He would rather be dead than spend another minute in this godforsaken place, far away from the simple life he knew as a child.</p><br><p>The lyrics of "Creeker" highlight the struggles of those who leave behind their roots and try to make a life in a new environment. The city can be a harsh and unforgiving place, and the pressure to belong and fit in can be overwhelming for many. Tyler Childers captures the loneliness and isolation of those who are lost in the city's chaos, and the longing for a simpler, more familiar life.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>In a small corner bar he sits there a-drinkin'</u><br>He's drinking in a tiny bar</p><br><p><u>Lost as a ball in a field full of corn</u><br>He's feeling disoriented</p><br><p><u>Further away than he ever imagined</u><br>He's far from where he grew up</p><br><p><u>That he'd ever end up from the place he was born</u><br>He's surprised by how much his life has changed</p><br><p><u>Now no more forlorn as the Creeker drank whiskey</u><br>Drinking eases his sadness</p><br><p><u>Than the one that you see outside of your eye</u><br>His drinking isn't obvious to others</p><br><p><u>Drinkin' alone as he looks out the window</u><br>He's alone and reflecting</p><br><p><u>At all of the strangers on the corner outside</u><br>He sees people he doesn't know</p><br><p><u>He'd rather be dead</u><br>He hates his life</p><br><p><u>Than alive one more minute</u><br>He doesn't want to continue living</p><br><p><u>In this godforsaken town</u><br>He hates where he is</p><br><p><u>When he was a kid</u><br>He remembers his childhood</p><br><p><u>Lord, he'd never have dreamt it</u><br>He's shocked by how different his life is now</p><br><p><u>All the ways that the city can bring a country boy down</u><br>The city has changed and hurt him</p><br><p><u>Now they knew not his name and he knew not their faces</u><br>He's anonymous and doesn't know anyone there</p><br><p><u>And he knew not the how nor the reason for why</u><br>He doesn't know why he's there</p><br><p><u>You could ever wake up and wanna keep on livin'</u><br>It's hard to find reasons to keep going</p><br><p><u>In a place where a friend is such a hard thing to find</u><br>It's hard to make friends there</p><br><p><u>And for everyone you meet there's a whole mess of people</u><br>Lots of bad people there</p><br><p><u>Tryin' like hell to pull you on down</u><br>They want to bring him down</p><br><p><u>To the level they're on and the trouble they're tendin'</u><br>They're full of trouble</p><br><p><u>In the mess that they've made, in the gutter they found</u><br>They've made their own troubles</p><br><p><u>Some fellas do drugs and things of that nature</u><br>Others cope differently</p><br><p><u>Some fellas chase girls to hang on their arm</u><br>Others seek relationships</p><br><p><u>Some fellas get by on practically nothin'</u><br>Others don't need much to survive</p><br><p><u>Some fellas get pissed in a small corner bar</u><br>Others drink and get angry too</p><br><p><u>And they'd rather be dead</u><br>They're unhappy</p><br><p><u>Than alive one more minute</u><br>They don't want to keep living like this</p><br><p><u>In this godforsaken town</u><br>They hate where they are</p><br><p><u>When they were all kids</u><br>They remember a happier time</p><br><p><u>Lord, they'd never have dreamt it</u><br>They're shocked by how different their lives are now</p><br><p><u>All the ways that the city can bring a country boy down</u><br>The city has changed and hurt them</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Warner Chappell Music, Inc.<br>Written by: Tyler Childers</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIypobKzq6KhoKWclafAcI%2FRnpyknaI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./thomas-ravenel-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Thomas Ravenel Net Worth</span></a>
