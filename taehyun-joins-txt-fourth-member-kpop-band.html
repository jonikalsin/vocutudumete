The k-pop label is repping their first major band since the iconic <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>BTS</strong></a>, and it‚Äôs shaping up to be an epic project. The new boy band, <strong>TXT</strong>, already had three members announced: leader <strong>Soobin</strong>, <strong>Yeonjun</strong>, and <strong>Hueningkai</strong>. Now, the label has announced the fourth cutie:&nbsp;<strong>Taehyun</strong>!&nbsp;Taehyun (aka&nbsp;Nam Tae-hyun), 24, is already a prolific alternative rock singer who runs his own label, South Buyers Club. He‚Äôs going to be a major asset to TXT.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Big Hit released</a> an introduction video for&nbsp;Taehyun after announcing the exciting news on January 18, at midnight KST (that‚Äôs 10:00am ET on January 17 for us ‚Äî Korea is 14 hours ahead!). The video, titled ‚ÄúWhat Do You Do?‚Äù is cute as hell. It shows&nbsp;Taehyun waking up by himself on the bus and touring through the countryside and in the city. When he‚Äôs not sightseeing, he‚Äôs playing around on his phone, taking silly selfies and videos. The bus drops him off, and we‚Äôre treated to visuals of him just standing around and looking handsome as all get out.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Big Hit fans are totally into this addition to TXT, though they‚Äôd rather have the band debut now instead of the label releasing more visuals! Dudes, us too. ‚Äú#TAEHYUN #TXT okay BH where are u founding all those perfect people ????‚Äù one fan tweeted, basically writing what we‚Äôre all thinking. ‚Äúhe‚Äôs beautiful AND fluent in english? sh*t i mean üëÄ‚Äù said another. And one fan tweeted, ‚ÄúOMFG he is soo beautiful like so so so beautiful,LOOK AT HIS F**KING NOSE,PPL CAN DO ANYTHING TO HAVE A SIMILAR NOSE #TAEHYUN‚Äù. Same!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH1ye5BwZq2ZlZ3GtrqMo6aipqNiwbnAjJ%2BmrqqknXquscybnKtlm6W8sXnBmqWdZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kyle-fraser.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Kyle Fraser- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Career</span></a>
