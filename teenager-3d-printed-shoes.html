I love them. Thank you.”</p><p>Based in California, Feetz feeds 3-D models of people’s feet into a 3-D printer, creating custom-fit shoes for a fraction of the ordinary price. The company uses photos taken through the Feetz app to make the 3-D models.</p><p>“We’ve never done a shoe this big before, but we’re just excited to get Broc some comfy shoes,” Beard said. “We’re really just honored to do this.”</p><p>This is indeed an extraordinary case. The <a href=#>Detriot Free Press</a> reports that roughly one in 15,000 people share Brown’s condition, also known as cerebral gigantism.</p><p>Given this condition, nobody knows when Brown will finish growing, as his aunt, Stacy Snyder, told the Jackson Citizen Patriot.</p><p>“I can walk in a store and walk out with five pairs of shoes if I want to,” she said. “He can’t.”</p><p>Beyond shoe problems, at the moment, Brown is plagued with chronic back and knee pain, as well as a variety of behavioral disorders, thanks to his condition, according to his aunt.</p><p>Despite such problems, Brown did enjoy being listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s tallest teenager, until he turned 18 last year and no longer qualified.</p><p>According to the Detroit Free Press, Brown now hopes that his new shoes can get him back into the book — but this time for having the world’s biggest pair of 3-D printed shoes.</p><p>Next, read up on the short life of <a href=#>Robert Wadlow, history’s tallest person</a>.
